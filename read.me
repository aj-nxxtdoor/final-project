 StudyTrack

A simple study task manager web app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 What It Does

StudyTrack lets you add, track, and manage your study tasks across sessions. You can:
- Add tasks with a title, subject, deadline, priority level, and optional notes
- View all your tasks on the dashboard, filtered and sorted however you like
- Mark tasks as done (or undo if you change your mind)
- Delete tasks you no longer need
- See quick stats about how many tasks you have and how many you've completed

All data is stored in `localStorage`, so nothing leaves your browser and no server is needed

TECHNOLOGY used

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

 How to Run

No build step needed. Just open `index.html` in any modern browser.

If you're using VS Code, the **Live Server** extension makes this easy.



 Known Issues / Limitations

- Data lives only in the browser — clearing site data will delete everything
- No user accounts or syncing between devices
- No drag-and-drop for reordering tasks (could add in future)
- Dates are stored as strings (YYYY-MM-DD) so sorting by deadline is basic

Future Ideas

- Add categories/tags beyond just subject
- Reminders or notifications for upcoming deadlines
- Export tasks to CSV
